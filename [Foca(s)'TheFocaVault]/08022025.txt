People say. That this is a tone. A tone of effect. Now what is it necessarily we are all prone to. What is it exactly a human being would be prone to and is it similar to fire. Like. Where it is burned and charcoaled over and there is no salvaging it. Annde do we even have the

chemo mechanism inside of us. Right there the digestive tract and have I completed the necessary transfiguration already have I completely come to. So is all of the ways found out and is the answer to drain the bodie' of all the remnants of what is considered, the cancer. You

just don't know but other doctors do and they need gangmembers, family persons and cartel figures with those mob'officials and the rest of the political design even with some cattle ranch and U.S. Armed Forces 'figures' now am I just caput. What does that mean and where is our

collective research going. Often the question is the answer. This is what I have come to and we have another child or grown adult with it and of what necessary organ does it have and is it all over. How dire has their situation become their medical one and can I live on??:-/;:-/;
