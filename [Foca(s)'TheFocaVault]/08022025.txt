People say. That this is a tone. A tone of effect. Now what is it necessarily we are all prone to. What is it exactly a human being would be prone to and is it similar to fire. Like. Where it is burned and charcoaled over and there is no salvaging it. Annde do we even have the

chemo mechanism inside of us. Right there the digestive tract and have I completed the necessary transfiguration already have I completely come to. So is all of the ways found out and is the answer to drain the bodie' of all the remnants of what is considered, the cancer. You

just don't know but other doctors do and they need gangmembers, family persons and cartel figures with those mob'officials and the rest of the political design even with some cattle ranch and U.S. Armed Forces 'figures' now am I just caput. What does that mean and where is our

collective research going. Often the question is the answer. This is what I have come to and we have another child or grown adult with it and of what necessary organ does it have and is it all over. How dire has their situation become their medical one and can I live on??:-/;:-/;

Couldn't be more than right // Right or wrong // I was the man // You was the woman // And I needed for it to hit me // For it has taken me // Momma // Pop pop // You know the Dad // That this is your Father // On speakin' to you and the need for it was their I said it was // In
fact // On there // And the need for it was already there // So I couldn't be more than right // I knew for I was couldn't // Annde I needed to be right // Oh'so right // And I thought to myself // Did I need a DJ right then and there // Oh'no how about some grape or even this::

Well first of all. This and this. You know the need for it. But at the end of the day. This. I know where to go. I know what I want and I needed this more than anything else. And I had my first steak nacho with shredded lettuce in years. I used to go out all the time but how far

can '298' go and you know what. Pretty far. Thats enough for 3 trips. Three buschels. Now. The checkout area is there. I'm self. Check out and I take my bike from my current 'SRO' and I have myself a time. And I park it. Right. I know I want the pannini I know I want the Chk. I

know I want my sweet'Tea with a bread fixin'. Now my friend Aaron just got me an Air Fryer and you know what. I can cook pizza, bagels, why even that steak I told you so much about. I just wanted to say to you. Illinois Link and Aldi not only that they go together and I do have a

@Walmart down the stweet. Essential. Basic-bottom/line offerins. At times the off-brand is better than thy name. Energy drinks. Milk and cereal why the breakfast items and I'm out-I'm just out. Like a light and thank you German operated and owned @AldiUSA for everything and this.
