The history of it with it along alongside the human race, as it enjoys this substance. Clearly initally prohibited
as anything good that tastes good that removes harm from us and in the process safegaurds us and lets us share
protective forces alongwithit'. Now from what I see until now is this. What can't it do. What are its limitations.
Rather simple quantity but yet to be explored and have we explored'explored all of its avenues. Even acting as a placebo
working its magic to make us feel good in this way. Now as a computer scientist is different take on the problems we
face as a human race in culmination of its ammassed knowledge. What do we have for ourselves. This with peanut butter
cooked and made is by far the greatest desert I have every had and available on any street corner, @Reeses--(*8/%9@Hersheys

The fantasy attached. I consider it one of the greatest consoles ever made and way of ahead of its time. The VMU is still-still
heralded. What a swan song. The company itself, @SEGA, is still a production company to watch with a distinct distinct game-engine
that is so pertinent it remains to be seen. Every @E3 it grabs news. Now that its in the past I would still pick this up to play 
classic games and so called--#(#)'
