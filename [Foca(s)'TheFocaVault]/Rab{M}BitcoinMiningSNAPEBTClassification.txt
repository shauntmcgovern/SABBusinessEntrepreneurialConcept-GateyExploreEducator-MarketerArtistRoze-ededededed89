I had alot of time. To think about it. How far does, '298' streetch. Well, about '3' bushels of "Grosh" meaning groceries. Doesn't it mean. As we talked about the last time. So I am about to file my "Redetermination" here:809. Now what that means to Shaun and living on other
people's backs. Is Shaun really livin' on a back? And does he oppress people or is Shaun livin' on the back. Where did this expression come from and where did it in fact start. From what Shaun can see here. Since, {I}, Roze fit into this income bracket meaning I make absolutely
no money. None money. And since I do not have any income to speak of coming from any other place to name right now, manual laboristic or a 'remote developer' job. Net income is thy '0'. Meaning I effectively need the government to stay open so I can claim my '298' that I
desperately need every month. If you do not file your Mid-Point Reference Report your funds get shut off. So always make sure halfway through the promised 'year' of $298 per month to fill out that paperwork. Then from there I hope my 'Redetermination' goes well and I still get it
What exactly other in-depth look can you take for SNAP-E(b)T and what'does'this'look'like:09;


What do I know about and what do I do not know about it. And why is it always equate to just one, which does not exist in this real time-sphere but a way to describe a digital 'era' being coin and this was the first one and there are several even dozens of different ones, however
exciting it may seem. So what you do is setup a farm and let it churn. Do you need some type of computer 'degree' here. A for-profit technology degree you say. If you have one of these digital coins it equates to upward of <='92,524.85$ my goodness. So lets figure out how this
works. Because not everyone can do this it looks like you setup a node from what I can see. Meaning you articulate it once inside 'Bitcoin' and this is a digital one that can be divided eight times. So in order to make one what do you need to work with and how do you make one
exactly. Firstly translate your money, chosen, into bitcoin and see what happens and then use it as a digital currency in any participating. Foremost. Which removes the B-A-N-K-S's. I could build @Bitcoin accepting type of applications:09;/;'. A farm mining--/'checks transactions
First of all, everybody would'like'Rab{M} to know how to mine{Mine} to effectively money off of Bit'coin and the very reason I suggested the name-brand
was this because its not only safe but the other bitcoin, digital currency monikers, work just fine and the more fine that we get the more necessarily time we have gotten to count
just how many different ways the digital-currency($) has affected the world in, a good and bad way, but the reason this was put in p@ce was because it need to remove
the big-big-big banks from the (Eq)uation entirely and did it successfully even do that? And do the banks still monitor things like this and that and do they even still'still
to this day have their hand in this and do they run this, digital currency equation where your effectively running a service and you still need the banks to effectively translate
you hard earned dough in this way and even setup a business transaction and that digitally. Now the reason was to remove the banks, and effectively the ingenuity is that, this
currency lets take for instance ""Bitcoin"/" who is leading and there are many others that are 'popular'but does this place accept it and whatnot"/" that it runs the Kurrency off
of the bank of users and because users are using the currency/"Kurren($)cy that would it turn mean that it can keep track of the money that you have in Bitcoin it can
then run your transactions for you based off of a tree-like system that the more popularity it has the more it can run effectively, turnly and quite timely efforts. Now I know
this goes over peoples heads. Like mine, when it comes to effectively mining a bitcoin farm and then making-money-unchecked from "thin air"
Run enough 'check transactions' and start churnin'
