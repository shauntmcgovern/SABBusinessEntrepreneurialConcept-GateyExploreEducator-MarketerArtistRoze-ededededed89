--did you get to watch {TNA}+/=' they kind of did a ('Revenge of WCW'{Nitro}+/=' thing):09/09:09/{st/w=}'
Everyone knows he carried, WCW after his stint with the World Wrestling and then 'W{W}E and then off to TNA it was even Impact'Impact and yes now as proven A-E-W and in his 60s
Well he just made an in-ring appearance and took out guys with the bat. He said it would be his last match, perhaps as a tag-team. It looks like so. ((AEW))' is promoting it as the last time in face paint and what that
means to us, the fans. Is that-if Sting, don't got no FacePaint on, that means he ain't wrestling period. Now I have watched his entire career. Sometimes I only catch the highlights. He made people watch wrestling again
and he carried various other organizations single handedly and sold alot of video games, face paint, costumes, established a persona and character so powerful it has transcended multiple genres-subjects and then sports itself.
AEW he showed the Punisher take and did do a re-hash from what I saw, and there is alot of other powerful fans you know that got to see him and follow his every move because they make time for this type of fellowship. I didn't 
set out the time nor money for him but I heard it was his last match. So I never will see my hero wrestle.-Sting-Sting-STING(%?/"-{w}+):09

Have you ever been to the Nike Store? Has the nike, transcended sports and did it setup multi-national-multi-{multi}-billion+/{=}'dollar.companies like myself. Did I mean to win at nike and do I even like Nike anymore and do you like
the cut of the jib. The jub or the rub is it? Well there isn't a time I do not like lookin' at the @Nike I mean it rubs me every which way in the right'ways. Does it represent us, in totality--then completely. Is it right. Or is it
doing by the right of us. What and who does it symbolize, correctly. Meaning does it establish one's own sexuality and livelihood, correctly?? Step.foot in the sto'(multi-level:09). I love the snap of the shoes:09. I like the finish
of the clothin:09. I like the very sharpness of the hats:09. By nike. For Nike and does it represent me correctly in the streets, business worlds and family concerns with your significant partner or partners in this way. How well
is the global representation of Nike going these days. Does it represent all of the total(5) ethnicities subsequently?? From black, to summer-sash stone, to the Bronze, to the very Yellows and/or thy skin'color:09 of Whiite?
