--did you get to watch {TNA}+/=' they kind of did a ('Revenge of WCW'{Nitro}+/=' thing):09/09:09/{st/w=}'
Everyone knows he carried, WCW after his stint with the World Wrestling and then 'W{W}E and then off to TNA it was even Impact'Impact and yes now as proven A-E-W and in his 60s
Well he just made an in-ring appearance and took out guys with the bat. He said it would be his last match, perhaps as a tag-team. It looks like so. ((AEW))' is promoting it as the last time in face paint and what that
means to us, the fans. Is that-if Sting, don't got no FacePaint on, that means he ain't wrestling period. Now I have watched his entire career. Sometimes I only catch the highlights. He made people watch wrestling again
and he carried various other organizations single handedly and sold alot of video games, face paint, costumes, established a persona and character so powerful it has transcended multiple genres-subjects and then sports itself.
AEW he showed the Punisher take and did do a re-hash from what I saw, and there is alot of other powerful fans you know that got to see him and follow his every move because they make time for this type of fellowship. I didn't 
set out the time nor money for him but I heard it was his last match. So I never will see my hero wrestle.-Sting-Sting-STING(%?/"-{w}+):09
--the Wrestlingship of Sting. Have you seen this Dynasty. He didn't wanna' be a Tag-Team. Well who wouldn't be. See how he was all alone. Their is a reason behind it that he doesn't do the rope thing anymore but he does plenty with just 
standing their and glistening. And its whom and he. How did he leave the business, is it still Vince-only McMahon's decision and why could that be the decision across all of the wrestling'companies, is-it-Vin((ce)):09. I mean the Sting fans then measured
it side-by-side and this is Sting not at the beginning of his career but at the end of his career, and when your in this age(s) he has told us as one of the most profressional but if not of the most successful bodybuilders with world has
ever'ever seen. That this is how the bodie goes. This is how the body ages. Like a fine piece of marble or that granite, concrete mind you. That side-by-then-side how did our Professional Wreslter do and he made sure to measure not the
tag-team he was made to promote with but him alone. Clearly. One of the Top'Wrestlers. "Last-time with Paint." Often he does the ""Filler"" which was such a huge payoff this time around in an ""AEW"" style annde' the feelings achieved
surrounding the pay-perview matches, were everything. Everything. And the promoted but not said, farewell to his last match as a tag-teamer, "Theatrical Last Grace" and Face. Moving that body around for another Stinger Splash, the stunts,
and the sledgehammer to the fucking head man, did he cheat ya.@AAA_ACG' The greatest memory from that match. I didn't exactly watch the, @TNA because I put wrestling down for a little while during my early teenage years and began workin'. 
From the World Wrestlemania match was not only the closure of how great WCW_Nitro was and Sting's career in general who was in an apex in his 40-years rather than his start when he was just bodybuildin', its called the BodyBuilding@WWF
'Federation:809 and the greatest entrance and the dancing around the whole match, was once again everything and he had a clever farewell during the 2010-decades it was. Since the 80s he has been wrestlin' WWF-WCW-TNA-WWE('HALLOFFAME:09)'the 
((AEW)) stint and iconoclast. Its like seeing your very father your mother's father and your brother's brother move around career, that darkness. I mean he was everything. Now he has to say another farewell, but during vocal'inflection he says
he's got another one in him, I would say he's got at least one more storyline and that how many episodes does that take to shot, like 90 or so. He isn't promoted as a tag-team, anymore--thanks ((Vince)):09. When he matches the esoteric spirit 
he has commanded through various shades of darkness into his persona, interviewing and promoting another ma'tch aside--((without paint as you can tell, very German indeed)), he becomes by far one of those wrestlers that you have dreamt of
alongside his good forces that check his buck and his plight that he is this formidable wrestler that can become greater than human, leave his human behind and grapple and throw with the best of 'em even the best wrestlers to this day. 
Entering and then planning out how to leave, as he proves just how technically difficult one's wrestling championship can be. A wrestling figure that can use the spirit of wrestling at his behest and become legendary in the same process.
There is only one Sting. Sting is all that is there and he represents your Father's might. 'Movie-esque and Anime-esque and ComicBook-esque with the music to tag along with it as well. Dramatic overtones but yet keeping it very light with
the body movement and the natural un-dying symbolism of a man living as a wrestler as he always has had and completing an entertainment venue and conquering said evil, those forces that wish to oppose ((STING)):09 who only represents the
Good in us and the rest of us, as the FAN'BASE.

Have you ever been to the Nike Store? Has the nike, transcended sports and did it setup multi-national-multi-{multi}-billion+/{=}'dollar.companies like myself. Did I mean to win at nike and do I even like Nike anymore and do you like
the cut of the jib. The jub or the rub is it? Well there isn't a time I do not like lookin' at the @Nike I mean it rubs me every which way in the right'ways. Does it represent us, in totality--then completely. Is it right. Or is it
doing by the right of us. What and who does it symbolize, correctly. Meaning does it establish one's own sexuality and livelihood, correctly?? Step.foot in the sto'(multi-level:09). I love the snap of the shoes:09. I like the finish
of the clothin:09. I like the very sharpness of the hats:09. By nike. For Nike and does it represent me correctly in the streets, business worlds and family concerns with your significant partner or partners in this way. How well
is the global representation of Nike going these days. Does it represent all of the total(5) ethnicities subsequently?? From black, to summer-sash stone, to the Bronze, to the very Yellows and/or thy skin'color:09 of Whiite?
