Everyone knows he carried, WCW after his stint with the World Wrestling and then 'W{W}E and then off to TNA it was even Impact'Impact and yes now as proven A-E-W and in his 60s
Well he just made an in-ring appearance and took out guys with the bat. He said it would be his last match, perhaps as a tag-team. It looks like so. AEW is promoting it as the last time in face paint and what that
means to us, the fans. Is that if Sting, don't got no FacePaint on, that means he ain't wrestling period. Now I have watched his entire career. Sometimes I only catch the highlights. He made people watch wrestling again
and he carried various other organizations single handedly and sold alot of video games, face paint, costumes, established a persona and character so powerful it has transcended multiple genres-subjects and then sports itself.
AEW he showed the Punisher take and did do a re-hash from what I saw, and there is alot of other powerful fans you know that got to see him and follow his every move because they make time for this type of fellowship. I didn't 
set out the time nor money for him but I heard it was his last match. So I never will see my hero wrestle.
