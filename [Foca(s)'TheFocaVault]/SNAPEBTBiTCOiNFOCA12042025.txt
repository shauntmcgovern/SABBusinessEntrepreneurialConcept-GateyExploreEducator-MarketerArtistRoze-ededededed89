I had alot of time. To think about it. How far does, '298' streetch. Well, about '3' bushels of "Grosh" meaning groceries. Doesn't it mean. As we talked about the last time. So I am about to file my "Redetermination" here:809. Now what that means to Shaun and living on other

people's backs. Is Shaun really livin' on a back? And does he oppress people or is Shaun livin' on the back. Where did this expression come from and where did it in fact start. From what Shaun can see here. Since, {I}, Roze fit into this income bracket meaning I make absolutely

no money. None money. And since I do not have any income to speak of coming from any other place to name right now, manual laboristic or a 'remote developer' job. Net income is thy '0'. Meaning I effectively need the government to stay open so I can claim my '298' that I

desperately need every month. If you do not file your Mid-Point Reference Report your funds get shut off. So always make sure halfway through the promised 'year' of $298 per month to fill out that paperwork. Then from there. I hope my 'Redetermination' goes well and I get it fine
