I had alot of time. To think about it. How far does, '298' streetch. Well, about '3' bushels of "Grosh" meaning groceries. Doesn't it mean. As we talked about the last time. So I am about to file my "Redetermination" here:809. Now what that means to Shaun and living on other

people's backs. Is Shaun really livin' on a back? And does he oppress people or is Shaun livin' on the back. Where did this expression come from and where did it in fact start. From what Shaun can see here. Since, {I}, Roze fit into this income bracket meaning I make absolutely

no money. None money. And since I do not have any income to speak of coming from any other place to name right now, manual laboristic or a 'remote developer' job. Net income is thy '0'. Meaning I effectively need the government to stay open so I can claim my '298' that I

desperately need every month. If you do not file your Mid-Point Reference Report your funds get shut off. So always make sure halfway through the promised 'year' of $298 per month to fill out that paperwork. Then from there I hope my 'Redetermination' goes well and I still get it

What do I know about and what do I do not know about it. And why is it always equate to just one, which does not exist in this real time-sphere but a way to describe a digital 'era' being coin and this was the first one and there are several even dozens of different ones, however

exciting it may seem. So what you do is setup a farm and let it churn. Do you need some type of computer 'degree' here. A for-profit technology degree you say. If you have one of these digital coins it equates to upward of <='92,524.85$ my goodness. So lets figure out how this

works. Because not everyone can do this it looks like you setup a node from what I can see. Meaning you articulate it once inside 'Bitcoin' and this is a digital one that can be divided eight times. So in order to make one what do you need to work with and how do you make one

exactly. Firstly translate your money, chosen, into bitcoin and see what happens and then use it as a digital currency in any participating. Foremost. Which removes the B-A-N-K-S's. I could build @Bitcoin accepting type of applications:09;/;'. A farm mining--/'checks transactions
