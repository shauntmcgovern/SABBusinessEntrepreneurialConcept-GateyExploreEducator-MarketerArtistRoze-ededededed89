Should there be a need for it
and the need for it was there

the cleanliness is always up there
TacoBells smell like this
BurgerKings smell like this
which one kinda smells better
and which one can you power through better because you like it mas'

so is it the baby changing area I don't know
and yes I have plucked a blunt in the B-room
we all do. no matter if its the reggie or kind of dro I guess.
legal in all 24-states then its all about marijuana now

its always a constant cleaing'process:09;:/;{L}'{{P}I/'OP};
what do you like on the menu for 'BK'
what do you like on the menu for 'T-BELL'
and then it don't stop, it just don't stop.
I tinkin' maybe'maybe T-BELL should teach us all Spanglesh. 
And maybe'maybe nowthatIwastinkin' maybeBURGERKING should all make us a little'little on the backside, 1-1, instead of pure purchase and little on the back of the throat--make me King'Queen Me--not in a coupon way'tho is the drive-thru experience is it the entrance
I know the power of its mascot means somethin to me
