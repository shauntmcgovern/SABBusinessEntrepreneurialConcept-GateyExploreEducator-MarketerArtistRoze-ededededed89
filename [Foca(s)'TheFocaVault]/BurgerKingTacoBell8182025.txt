Should there be a need for it
and the need for it was there

the cleanliness is always up there
TacoBells smell like this
BurgerKings smell like this
which one kinda smells better
and which one can you power through better because you like it mas'

so is it the baby changing area I don't know
and yes I have plucked a blunt in the B-room
we all do. no matter if its the reggie or kind of dro I guess.
legal in all 24-states then its all about marijuana now

its always a constant cleaing'process:09;:/;{L}'{{P}I/'OP};
what do you like on the menu for 'BK'
what do you like on the menu for 'T-BELL'
and then it don't stop, it just don't stop.
I tinkin' maybe'maybe T-BELL should teach us all Spanglesh. 
And maybe'maybe nowthatIwastinkin' maybeBURGERKING should all make us a little'little on the backside, 1-1, instead of pure purchase and little on the back of the throat--make me King'Queen Me--not in a coupon way'tho is the drive-thru experience is it the entrance
I know the power of its mascot means somethin to me

Would it be good for that finish. This is what I like about it. Roze. Do paint it plain finish, definitely. As a young boy I always got 3 and 3 and didn't bother to busy up the order with no cheese but I learned to love the cheese on the 3 hard 3 soft taco. When the cheesy
chalupa crunch came around I also learned to ask for easy sauce but not necessarily #86. Now as for the desert items and the one of kind offering, churros it can take me back to simpler times. We are working with the bell and I always think its a love note by our Hispanic faith.
My wife, one of 'em, is a Mexican. She loves when a white man such as I. Gorges. Annde in her presence nothing better then to afford us both T-Bell and then take her home with me. I haven't gotten sick on it but I do diet off of it as with any fast food you see. Americas pastime.

Well first of all I like the chances they are taking with their breakfast items. However notable they can be to outlast. As for the 'King' it isn't going anywhere and the Whopper is so so Americana its crazy. Now I know you say your not a fan of chk'fries. Thats okay. Their are
other items for you to note. However notable they may seem and also take note the drink area and the offering near the fountain. These are the things that comeby, that we notice. Flame-broiled. When it comes to consumerism in the USA I always dream of an American company offering
something to us rather than just becoming said Kings and Queens. I remember the day as a young boy wearing a crown and having it take this effect. Its not that often but I do like to take in the King and its history and continued perseverance through this economy as a fast food//
