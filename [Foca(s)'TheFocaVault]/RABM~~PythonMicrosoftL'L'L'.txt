(Python')
Graphical User Interfaces is wide-ranging. Mostly, programs--applications desktop use laptop use tablet use watch use and phone use and those are the big 5(5') these days.
What you are talking, now using the specific programming languauge known, as @Python, and all of its use. Leaving a develop environment would entail a copy of an application or
program that would be used by all and you only would need to make one and the user then uses it to its utter full capability and that is the great thing about one of the laws of Computer
Science itself. Web development, would use @django a widely popular and most-used web development IDE using @Python to do a wide-ranging of things but yet not limited to only
alas Websites and we have seen the development the very production of what these are and from across the board its all the same until you realize what you need to do use the
website for and that usually accounts to one of the abilities, listed on the Python Package Index website and once you install a Python Package once its capable you can use that
to very develop an ability within the @Django Web Development Environment then leaving a very way to describe your website and what it just does for the, [public_user]. Fascinating.
Now these are all @Python-powered. Moving on we have 'System,,,(0')' Administration::0/s/0')'PS/0T'""-_'[]+/=' with ""LSB""--0=Linux Standard Base0=we have a form of 'polymorphism' at hand.
Working with the @LinuxFoundation and what that means is what do we need to update, yes what packages what libraries what variables even, of how we setup a companies system how we operate it
how we store anything we need to save with it and how generally this System, works with the --Select'"(0/9s//(//0)"y)'st::Company younameit. Productivity, PyUno, https://pypi.org/project/pyuno/ and
the https://www.documentfoundation.org/ working to develop https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice, to its very best extent used to be the well-known OpenOffice.org an alternative to the
most-widely used and multi-platform available @MicrosoftOffice''365. When it comes to 'Data Science' thats only a term to effectively learn from information==data and to then use it to its 
fullest extent in a way that is beneficial for example you would have to setup this to become good at it, https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html and https://matplotlib.org/'' which 
helps you visualize with Python the programming languauge and both of these have references and walkthroughs in order to get off the ground-running and use these tools in a devlopment environment
along with your website, your program, your companies system or even LibreOffice. Machine Learning is realitively new but ever since the first computer, when @Bill Gates built the very
first Desktop PC with a GUI for @Microsoft you had a machine remembering what has transpired even completing words for you in the earliest of stages and yes, saving your work for you when you begin
to get into @TensorFlow, https://www.tensorflow.org/, ===(/P)'https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues===(//P)'
and @PyTorch, https://pytorch.org/, =='https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-PyTorch-Contributions==/'

PythonProgramming((Inheritance && DataAssociation))
https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_inheritance.asp
((w3 is intermediate and not advanced level of programming'gramming:09)
Once a class is written in Python. With any instruction. It can then be passed on to a different class and in this example, for it be Python, you have a new class using the properties of the 
class orginally written in Python. Leaving this new class with what the original class has done, in its PythonProperties. There is a place to attribute the first and last name, it could have 
a place to inherit the address of this, exampleStudent-x; And it has a print method. Now methods are as big as inheritance. Inheritance really means you do not have to do the same programming task
again and if the program is calling for it it knows what exactly to do and from that step forward you do not need to program these same steps in repetition, meaning that it is already done in
the first place with the Parent class representing the various ((Child)) classes and from that step on these child classes can do the same as the Parent once did so no need to program the same
instruction about what to do and thats the great thing about inheritance.

--Data Mining(({F}))
This gets into how well Python understands images leading to graphs leading to data visuals that take any form of data and correctly mathematically graph it so the programming not only better
understands but the ((User)) as well. From there, you have data-association leading to mathematical content in this that would be most valuable to the human eye, the digitil eye and the same name
as better. Better how it would be. You have a way to duelve into information and break it down into pieces that are better understood. Leaving nothing in its place, but understanding. As the program mines
you program it to visualize exactly what information that you want to see. For example, the grand example, of a store customer buying something it likes in the past and in response the storeOffers a candy
that is in similarity or a different kind of candy by that same brand knowing that this ExampleCustomer bought one of these specific candies in the past. So what you are seeing is mathematical representation
leading to its assertion leading to its data association. From what there, you have a beautiful way to understand information leaving nothing in question, and I mean the ends and outs of information, everything 
about the data.

Interview with Bill[Gates]'

::Do you think that ArtificialIntelligence ever existed...:09::
BG::')C0::T/'Good Question. The question concerning what is all that is there for that matter. And the brain automatically thinks of Egyptian Times and what this does next is bring up a frame up close. 
For the frames that are there. What is up to these Egyptian times, again. What is this for. What is this needed for. But let us get back to has it ever existed, well, ever since the first crack, gash and
wallow on the forearm it has been known as ArtificialIntelligence for that matter. For us this matters. And WhatNot. 
..So beginning to tell me to you. That you are thinking about ArtificialIntelligence in the right way but here is the giant Critique() and what your getting is all their Shaun. So take the heavy scathe and I mean heavy.
You have merely played PluralNouns():-;O')L__0').>M?/:-;:-;?/'"-{M}'l and What{""/Not\""}st:-;-L{-}+/=
You think that Bill Gates is good at Artificial Intelligence.

:::Do you think that Artificial Intelligence should be narrated:09:::C?/;"-'-{M}'
We don't even know what it is yet, narrated. I know Shaun thats where your mind is exactly going and What{""/(?<,9/0.>')0"-_/'"|"'-:.\\(k)'t?/'Not(0."?/9$k"-_':-/;L:'Not}+/= But so, let me be Clear very(Clear).
You have this and have that. Do you need narration, narration exactly. Do you need this to end for your time in this time and in this endtime' being your time and WhatNot?/9.9/9m=={C+}+/=={==}'

:::Do you think that Artificial'Intelligence can ever'be'1on'(e:09::
A:I think so, not only do I know so but I think that it shares kindred nature with us and that is'us. Formethemore' Tobekno-o-owun. It would be the last stop. The ditch end.

:::Do you think Bill that you lead to Artificial'Intelligence:09::
A:I think so. I think that I did. 
//Meaning?'(CSOT)
AA:I think that I did. 
//(//)'Meaning that you did what, exactly as the creator of the computer and Windows the Desktop.
AA(AA):I created windows I created the personal Desktop Computer.
(AA)(AA)(AA)'Do you think that I wanted to leave at the end of Xbox'
(AA)(AA)(.AA)'Do you think that Artificial'Intelligence ever existed'Shaun(:0C'9)doyouT'hink::-;so?-+/=I think that it never did, look at my previous question(Egyptian)
(AA)(AA)(.AA)(.AA)'Holdmyhand'

:::Bill do you think the earth was ready for your exit, after said Xbox':09::
A:I think so and I knew the world was so. Moving on, there is alot of great'things that are happening with the latest iteration and X'box series X and the past iteration X'boxOn'e) and before that the 360. Alot of people realize that we jumped into this thing when the Playstation'2 came out and that was really hard to do and what Steam just did was emulate the latest and greatest PC'Graphics upon a [handheld]
console and that is a big move, its a strong bold courageous move and what we did was import the 'pc' to the latest and greatest console so basically its a mini-console and that thing with Gabe, saying a console is just a pc or a pc is just a console, got blown I mean blown way out of porportion.
