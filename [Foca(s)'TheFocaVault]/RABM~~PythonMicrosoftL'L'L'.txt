(Python')
Graphical User Interfaces is wide-ranging. Mostly, programs--applications desktop use laptop use tablet use watch use and phone use and those are the big 5(5') these days.
What you are talking, now using the specific programming languauge known, as @Python, and all of its use. Leaving a develop environment would entail a copy of an application or
program that would be used by all and you only would need to make one and the user then uses it to its utter full capability and that is the great thing about one of the laws of Computer
Science itself. Web development, would use @django a widely popular and most-used web development IDE using @Python to do a wide-ranging of things but yet not limited to only
alas Websites and we have seen the development the very production of what these are and from across the board its all the same until you realize what you need to do use the
website for and that usually accounts to one of the abilities, listed on the Python Package Index website and once you install a Python Package once its capable you can use that
to very develop an ability within the @Django Web Development Environment then leaving a very way to describe your website and what it just does for the, [public_user]. Fascinating.
Now these are all @Python-powered. Moving on we have 'System,,,(0')' Administration::0/s/0')'PS/0T'""-_'[]+/=' with ""LSB""--0=Linux Standard Base0=we have a form of 'polymorphism' at hand.
Working with the @LinuxFoundation and what that means is what do we need to update, yes what packages what libraries what variables even, of how we setup a companies system how we operate it
how we store anything we need to save with it and how generally this System, works with the --Select'"(0/9s//(//0)"y)'st::Company younameit. Productivity, PyUno, https://pypi.org/project/pyuno/ and
the https://www.documentfoundation.org/ working to develop https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice, to its very best extent used to be the well-known OpenOffice.org an alternative to the
most-widely used and multi-platform available @MicrosoftOffice''365. When it comes to 'Data Science' thats only a term to effectively learn from information==data and to then use it to its 
fullest extent in a way that is beneficial for example you would have to setup this to become good at it, https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html and https://matplotlib.org/'' which 
helps you visualize with Python the programming languauge and both of these have references and walkthroughs in order to get off the ground-running and use these tools in a devlopment environment
along with your website, your program, your companies system or even LibreOffice. Machine Learning is realitively new but ever since the first computer, when @Bill Gates built the very
first Desktop PC with a GUI for @Microsoft you had a machine remembering what has transpired even completing words for you in the earliest of stages and yes, saving your work for you when you begin
to get into @TensorFlow, https://www.tensorflow.org/, ===(/P)'https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues===(//P)'
