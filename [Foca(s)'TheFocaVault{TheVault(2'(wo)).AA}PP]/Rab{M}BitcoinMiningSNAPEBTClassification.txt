I had alot of time. To think about it. How far does, '298' streetch. Well, about '3' bushels of "Grosh" meaning groceries. Doesn't it mean.
As we talked about the last time. So I am about to file my "Redetermination" here:809. Now what that means to Shaun and living on other
people's backs. Is Shaun really livin' on a back? And does he oppress people or is Shaun livin' on the back.
Where did this expression come from and where did it in fact start. From what Shaun can see here. Since, {I},
Roze fit into this income bracket meaning I make absolutely
no money. None money. And since I do not have any income to speak of coming from any other place to name right now,
manual laboristic or a 'remote developer' job. Net income is thy '0'. Meaning I effectively need the government to stay open so I can claim my '298' that I
desperately need every month. If you do not file your Mid-Point Reference Report your funds get shut off. So always make sure halfway through the
promised 'year' of $298 per month to fill out that paperwork. Then from there I hope my 'Redetermination' goes well and I still get it

What exactly other in-depth look can you take for SNAP-E(b)T and what'does'this'look'like:09;
(First part, an RABM is meant to build off of a 'Foca and go extensively in-depth today we are establishing the well-known internet gem of can you single-handlely make money in a chosen 'digital currency'(there's about 8-10 of 'em
and churn.(Because you effectively pooled and got rewarded in that chosen'coin):09 and finally making it significantly easier and this is a state-by-state basis I think generally every state handles{les} the 'Link the same and this has
taken, the RABM, this note and effect--effectively and attenionaly easier for people to achieve their link cards if they so require, like Shaun-no income if he did what would be then the limit as a barback I only made close to a grand per month,
so about 12k-20,000per year and would (Shaun:09) still get it, his Li{i}nk'Card::'(/'quite:☒☒':-')'@HashbangGames'@HashbangGames:09:09:09s'/t

(Original Foca)'What do I know about and what do I do not know about it. And why is it always equate to just one, which does not exist in this real time-sphere but a way to
describe a digital 'era' being coin and this was the first one and there are several even dozens of different ones, however
exciting it may seem. ""So what you do is setup a farm and let it churn."/" Do you need some type of computer 'degree' here. A for-profit-technology-degree you say.
If you have one of these digital coins it equates to upward of <='92,524.85$(Bitcoin#'# style) my goodness. So lets figure out how this
works. Because not everyone can do this it looks like you setup a node from what I can see. Meaning you articulate it once inside 'Bitcoin' and this is a digital
one that can be divided eight times. So in order to make one what do you need to work with and how do you make one
exactly. Firstly translate your money, chosen, into b{B}itcoin and see what happens and then use it as a digital currency in any participating. Foremost.
Which removes the B-A-N-K-S's. I could build @Bitcoin accepting type of applications:09;/;' which if popular'popular enough it could turn that fantasized 'Bitcoin#Mining#Dollar'. 
A well-used application farm mining transactions--/'which{checks}'checks transactions. 
-P
First of all, everybody would'like'TheeRab{M} to know how to mine{Mine} to effectively
MakeMoney off of Bit'{#coin#}coin and the very reason I suggested the n{N}ame--{f\w}+/='{Brwand}brand was this because its not only safe but the other bitcoin--DigitalCurrencyMonikers as faceRunner??/s#',
representing the very pile of money translated into Bitcoin and then back again would be hoodCovers, making BitcoinBigDaddy and the onlyCoin#'
Its just fine and the more fine that we get the more necessarily time we have gotten to count
just how many different ways the digital-currency($) has affected the world in, a good and bad way, but the reason this was put in p@ce was because it needed to remove
the ((big-big-big))' banks from the (Eq)uation entirely and did it successfully (even do that)? And do the banks still monitor things like this and that and do they even still'still
to this day have their hand in this and do they run this, digital currency equation where your effectively running a service and you still need the banks to effectively translate
you hard earned dough in this way and even setup a business transaction and that digitally. Now the reason was to remove the banks, and effectively the ingenuity is that, this
currency lets take for instance ""Bitcoin"/" who is leading and there are many others that are 'popular'but does this place accept it(do you accept this type of Bitcoin#' and that
digitalCurrency' or is it just Big Poppa'#coin):09and whatnot"/"that it runs the Kurrency off of the bank of users and because users are using the currency/"Kurren($)cy that would
it turn mean that it can keep track of the money that you have in Bitcoin it can then run your transactions for you based off of a tree-like(Annonymous-like) system that the more popularity
it has the more it can run effectively, turnly and quite timely efforts(alot like the popular torrents and sharing Appi's):09:09/'. Now I know
this goes over peoples heads. Like mine, when it comes to effectively mining a bitcoin-farm(which isn't as advertised anymore just strictly working as a DigitalCurrency just simply reported:09) and then 
making-money-unchecked from "thin air". Run enough 'check transactions' and start churnin' Bitcoin#'Money-Making+/='(+/=0/')"/='0')+/=Dollar($)s'

(ASCI'ss'ASCI's)
-- uses specialized hardware called Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) designed solely to solve the SHA-256 cryptographic puzzles for Bitcoin, making them vastly
faster and more efficient than general-purpose CPUs or GPUs. These powerful, but noisy and power-hungry machines (like Bitmain's Antminers) have become the industry standard,
dramatically increasing mining difficulty and requiring miners to join pools and manage significant electricity costs for profitability, with a typical hardware lifespan of 2-4 profitable years before obsolescence.--
1. Transactions are Grouped: New Bitcoin transactions are bundled together into a "block".
2. Hashing the Block: Miners take the data from the block and run it through a cryptographic function (hashing) to produce a unique, fixed-length string of characters (a hash).
3. The Puzzle: Miners then repeatedly guess a random number (a "nonce") and hash it with the block data, trying to find a hash that meets specific network criteria (e.g., starts with a certain number of zeros).
4. Competition: Thousands of specialized computers (ASICs) compete globally, performing trillions of guesses per second (hashing) to find the correct nonce first.
5. Block Validation: The first miner to find the valid hash wins the right to add their block to the public, decentralized blockchain.
6. Reward: The winning miner receives a reward of newly created bitcoins (the block reward) plus transaction fees from the block.
Blockchain: A public, distributed digital ledger recording all Bitcoin transactions.
--Decentralization: No central authority; the network of miners maintains the ledger.
Proof-of-Work: The computational effort required to solve the puzzle, which secures the network.
--Mining Pools: Groups of miners combining power for more consistent, shared rewards.
(Bitcoin vs. Ethereum)
Bitcoin primarily serves as a decentralized, finite "digital gold" store of value, while Ethereum is a versatile platform for smart contracts, dApps, and DeFi,
using Ether (ETH) for network fuel, making them distinct in purpose, technology (PoW vs. PoS), and supply, though both are leading cryptocurrencies.

--As far as I am concerned where can I then use this digital currency when and can I staid paid and then use it to buy material or other digital (ent)tities. Furthermore, we have all seen the exciting ATM{s/w"} in the 
available centers, it looks strictly just #'Bitcoin the leader in digital currency known as the gold-extent in the online'world, so that was also part of the situation'decision--can I buy and use this digital'currency

Reclaim my benefits. Fill out the paperwork that Shaun, {{/I':0}}+/= is effectively still homelessness and that I have absolutely no income to speak of and that I have nothing against the dotted line. So in order to 
fill in that income gap, which I know there is a limit because if you are first of all a {Single} or a /"{Family::/'}+/=' and you make this certain amount of income per year'it must be under at most 30k or under. If you
make more that as yourself or make more than say, lets guess--50k or so as a family of (four)' would you not be considered for the said 'L{i}ink. So what Shaun does, is go in their and prove he makes no money. Zero income.
So that means he is entitled to his {back}:09 his forthworth because if he wasn't he be making money for his Intelligence and the Artificial kind which is called'{{I:0}}/+'= but he doesn't. Now Shaun. Lonely Shaun. Hero Shaun.
