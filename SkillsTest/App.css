Shaun is iffy' if this coding project requires this Bearer'token the reason why you would need to do this for this 'Project couldbe'::-);
In JavaScript, you interact with bearer tokens primarily by retrieving the token "/"after a user logs in"/'"(So Shaun could get by by only using the first method)'and then including it in the Authorization HTTP header of subsequent requests to protected API endpoints

 (what node.js(MyEclipse and a React'Project):09 does and I am new to this even tho' I have 10 years since my graduation it makes the server call from your client
 example codebase that you are using in 'realtime' essentially it could make updated API calls with 
 the bearer and token commands, that is why you would use next or react.js in order to setup a current node.js application because we need to make that call:09', but since we are at the Library{Which'Is'Public}::-; its not only
 out of the question--we might need to use (NODE.JS) and effectively we might be out of Public'Library Contention:09'sw')just like with J'ames swappin' verification codes and we are not even done with the interview'process we still
 with the current ""CTO"" hammer out a algorithmic style one and the last coding test it went well but at the same time, Shaun had to explain every step in the process and then go over the references of just how to print a String 
 backwards on through the method it turned out to  be a simple-for-loop didn't it Jam£s'/sw(And I thank you, for the continued opportunity I have netted(250$ for my t'rouble):09')/?::-st')0
In the Adobe XD template, there is a graph showing the blood pressure of the patients each year. We recommend using
--https://www.chartjs.org/{What this means is that once you somehow coding grab the specific information(data) from the JSON for example 'Jessica Taylor's then what you need to do is create it just like the Adobe'Mocked UP{P}':09PS'T).
--Here is the FirstExample the method at play and finally the Prototype and first Building Block to start off to code a chart within an html at anytime'

Now what needs to happen since you are using a REACT(JAVASCRIPT/CSS/HTML style through the WebStorm available CPL'IDE) you actually need to install these npm's
pnpm add react-chartjs-2 chart.js
# or
yarn add react-chartjs-2 chart.js
# or


npm i react-chartjs-2 chart.js
while inside the App.js (doc#ment)
while inside of MyEclipse'MyEclipse with Node.js
so once you update your project with these available npm's then you can use'them with
--chart.js@^4.0.0--


---First we need to create a subsequent project in HTML and CSS both working accordingly, we are going to try to make the CSS the 'it' and the HTML the 'stylized'(lets shop an IDE for the 'CPL((webStorm)))
https://www.jdoodle.com/execute-nodejs-online--this might allow you to 'online' use Node.js features and compliation
https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/--it hit the CPL'firewall('I just setup an example React.js 'App' and its these three files the .HTML the APP.JavaScript File and finally the APP.Cascading Style Sheet
and looks as'if it installed an 'NPM' what that is a necessary fileset that will allow perhaps NODE to work and make an authentication'API Style' call but that is yet to be determined here.. because
Webstorm is running a React.App() with Node.JS() its 'npm' on installed:09's't:093'9))y||':/-)'x

--let us continue on to--A specific Javascript(IDE)that has a React Plugin(builtin)My_Eclipse which is now running a better way to install Charts, and what we are trying to do now is this install the
Chart.npm in order to work with the React.Plugin that I currently have {setup} on the MyEclipse{(IDE)} once we have this done then we can begin to see if Shaun can in fact create a chart React Style within the I{D}E
Shaun just figured out how to install this Plugin(node_Module)NPM package while using MyEclipse and now it is correctly installed with this one command, and MyEclipse is using NODE.JS builtin so that is how this was done'::-;


((npm install chart.js --save))
((npm i react-chartjs-2 chart.js))
After you setup the Chartjs library inside of the current 'MyEclipse' Project, the choice is to run a function in the App.js file to retrieve the JSON DATA, from the example API, which is on lock it isn't public and speaking of 
public, this rule of thumb has been found here*'Due to browser security restrictions on accessing local files with fetch, you cannot simply open the HTML file locally. You need a simple web server to serve the files. You can use
--so within MyEclipse that is a LocalServerEnvironment and you have to run the server, from ReactServ which means it is generating from Node.js meaning I can't trial and error this with the index.html file any longer like before 
and will have to do it this way.--(it did fetch (20) but 'Undefined' because you are not calling it correctly, my young Padawan.>:?/'

inside of the MyEclipseTerminal, which means I am ready to use this--Chart.JS
the very next step is to setup a chart example meaning shaun will have to change it around for 'Jessica Taylor's' PatientInformation once grabbed.
import { Chart as ChartJS, ArcElement, Tooltip, Legend } from "chart.js";//I do see this library installed in my project
import { Doughnut } from "react-chartjs-2";//I do not see this library installed in my project-- so I did this now it is there and avail'npm i react-chartjs-2 chart.js)):/')):-;
this line your able to use the recently install npm'package known as the most widely used chart library and toolset from 'chartjs' and from here
 --your telling the App.js to use the packages from Chart's ChartJs, its ArcElement its ToolTip and its Legend
 --then your importing another toolset from the library called Doughnut by the 'chartjs' development team

ChartJS.register(ArcElement, Tooltip, Legend);
//what this does is run the ChartJS 'method' the register method that requires the ArcElement and Tooltip and Legend to pass on through this Javascript'React'Method

//<Doughnut data={...} />





However, feel free to use any other chart or graph library if you’re more comfortable with that.
<,while in the HTML and accompannied by the CSS you have for each set of informations use this 'chartCreation tool without Node because this is the Library and just plain.JavaScript()' create a chart successfully to look like the mockup'ADOBE.XD()'style:PXT'09)

Once you complete the test, create a single zip file of all the files used in creating your submission.
Only supplying minified files can affect your score, so please ensure the source files are also included.
Once the zip file has been created, please update it on the application page.

Important Notes:
You may use React, Next.js, Vue.js, and other frameworks as long as you include the HTML file for us to be able to review your submission.
Display information only for Jessica Taylor; do not bother displaying other patients' data, as this will not yield extra points in the skills test.
Avoid spending time on UI interaction that is not present in the template. For example, A. spending time working on the logic and interaction of the search button
B. spending time trying to code a dropdown for the gear icon. C. spending time to work on the interaction with the ellipses (...) in the side navigation
Doing these will not yield you any extra points. Instead, please focus on implementing the best coding practices and matching the designs.
Goal is to convert this into a single page response site. Please make sure to read the INSTRUCTIONS and IMPORTANT NOTES on the guide given.
